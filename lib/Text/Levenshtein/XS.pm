=head1 NAME

Text::Levenshtein::XS - Calculate edit distance based on insertion, deletion, substitution, and transposition

=head1 VERSION

version 0.429

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Levenshtein::XS qw/distance/;

    print distance('Neil','Niel');
    # prints 2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Returns the number of edits (insert,delete,substitute) required to turn the source string into the target string. XS implementation (requires a C compiler). Works correctly with utf8.

    use Text::Levenshtein::XS qw/distance/;
    use utf8;

    distance('ⓕⓞⓤⓡ','ⓕⓤⓞⓡ'), 
    # prints 2

=head1 METHODS

=head2 distance

=over 4

=item Arguments: $source_text, $target_text, (optional) $max_distance

=item Return Value: Int $edit_distance || undef (if max_distance is exceeded)

=back

Returns: int that represents the edit distance between the two argument, or undef if $max_distance threshold is exceeded.

Takes the edit distance between a source and target string using XS 2 vector implementation.

    use Text::Levenshtein::XS qw/distance/;
    print distance('Neil','Niel');
    # prints 2

Stops calculations and returns undef if $max_distance is set, non-zero (0 = no limit), and the algorithm has determined the final distance will be greater than $max_distance.

    my $distance = distance('Neil','Niel',1);
    print (defined $distance) ? $distance : "Exceeded max distance";
    # prints "Exceeded max distance"
